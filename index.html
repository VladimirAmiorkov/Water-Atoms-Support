<h1>Water Atoms</h1>
<h3>Staying hydrated made easy</h3>
<p>"Do I drink enough water?" "Am I hydrated?" "I forgot to drink water again!", this are just a few questions that we may ask ourselves very often. We all know drinking water is very important and we tell ourselves that today I will drink enough water. This is easer said than done. As we get swooped by our daily tasks and lives and we forget this simple but very important task, to drink enough water.
    And this is the core idea behind "Water Atoms", a simple, easy and fast to use app with a simple purpose "Make sure that your are correctly hydrated during your day."</p>
